# AnswerMe!

### What is AnswerMe!?
AnswerMe! is a website designed for exchanging knowledge, similar to other Q&A forums such as Quora. It allows asking questions, answering said questions, and commenting under both questions and answers. A voting system is implemented, and tags can be applied to posts. User profiles can be viewed, and the user can choose which information to make publicly available.

### Motivation
This project was developed in the context of the LBAW (Web Applications & Database Lab) course unit, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of the Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering @ FEUP, by a group composed by me, [Wallen Ribeiro](https://github.com/Wallen-Ribeiro), [Lino Vaz](https://github.com/LinusVaz) and [Diogo Martins](https://github.com/DiogoMartins888), with mentoring by [Edgar Carneiro](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro).

### Technologies used
The website was developed using the Laravel framework, with PostgreSQL for the database management. This repository is a clone of the original GitLab repository.
